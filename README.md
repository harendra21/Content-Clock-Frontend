Hi, In today's video, I will talk about how you can use Apache Kafka with Golang.
To use Apache kafka with golang we have to install the confluent-kafka-go package.
Then we have to import this package in our code and create a connection with Apache Kafka.
In the next step, we have to Build a Producer, which is used for publishing or writing events to a Kafka cluster.
Then we built Consumer, which is used to fetch and digest streams of data.
Now your application is ready to use kafa with golang.
To see the full example you can visit my blog, I will provide the link in the description and comment section.
